# StorySpark Kids

StorySpark Kids is a magical, interactive storybook web application designed for children. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI models to generate unique stories, illustrations, and narration on the fly, fostering creativity and reading skills.

## Features

### 1. Magic Story Maker
*   **Instant Story Generation**: Kids can enter a simple topic (e.g., "A dragon who loves ice cream"), and the app uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to write a complete, multi-page story suitable for their age group.
*   **AI Illustrations**: Every page comes with a unique illustration generated by **Imagen 3**, visualizing the story text in a colorful, kid-friendly style.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The app reads the story aloud using **Gemini 1.5 Flash** TTS capabilities, helping children learn to read.

### 2. Create Your Own Story
*   **Custom Story Builder**: A dedicated mode where children (or parents) can write their own stories page by page.
*   **Rich Text Editing**: Basic formatting tools (Bold, Italic) to emphasize parts of the story.
*   **AI Illustrator**: Users can write a description for a picture and hit "Paint" to have AI generate the artwork for their custom story.

### 3. Interactive Reading & Recording
*   **Read to Me**: High-quality AI narration.
*   **Voice Recording**: Children can record themselves reading the story page-by-page to practice reading aloud.
*   **Dedications**: Users can record a special "Dedication" message (e.g., "For Grandma, love Timmy") that is attached to the story.

### 4. AI Chatbot Companion
*   **StorySpark Bot**: A safe, friendly chatbot powered by **Gemini 1.5 Pro** that kids can talk to about their stories, science, or anything else.
