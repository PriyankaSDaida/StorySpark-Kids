## 🌟 Features

### 🧙‍♂️ 1. Magic Story Maker
*   **Instant Story Generation**: Kids can enter a simple topic (e.g., *"A dragon who loves ice cream"* 🍦), and the app uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to write a complete, multi-page story suitable for their age group.
*   **🎨 AI Illustrations**: Every page comes with a unique illustration generated by **Imagen 3**, visualizing the story text in a colorful, kid-friendly style.
*   **🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The app reads the story aloud using **Gemini 1.5 Flash** TTS capabilities, helping children learn to read.

### 🎨 2. Create Your Own Story
*   **Custom Story Builder**: A dedicated mode where children (or parents) can write their own stories page by page. ✍️
*   **Rich Text Editing**: Basic formatting tools (**Bold**, *Italic*) to emphasize parts of the story.
*   **AI Illustrator**: Write a description for a picture and hit **"Paint"** 🖌️ to have AI generate the artwork for your custom story!

### 🎤 3. Interactive Reading & Recording
*   **Read to Me**: High-quality AI narration. 🎧
*   **Voice Recording**: Children can record themselves reading the story page-by-page to practice reading aloud. 🎙️
*   **Dedications**: Users can record a special **"Dedication"** message (e.g., *"For Grandma, love Timmy"* ❤️) that is attached to the story.

### 🤖 4. AI Chatbot Companion
*   **StorySpark Bot**: A safe, friendly chatbot powered by **Gemini 1.5 Pro** that kids can talk to about their stories, science, dinosaurs, or magic! 🦖
